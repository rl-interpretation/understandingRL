CR[qc](;B[qd];W[pc]C[Wrong.
Poor judgment. Black blocks off the upper right side, but Black needlessly gives White extra points at the top.])
(;B[pc];W[pb]C[Pushing here 1st is correct judgment.

White hanes to connect...](;B[qd];W[rb]C[Correct again! 

White protects the cutting point...];B[rc];W[qb]C[Correct.
Correct!

In sente, Black secures the right side territory in conjunction with the marked stones.]TR[oj]TR[qj])
(;B[ob];W[qb]C[Sometimes this hane is good, but not here.];B[oc]TR[ob]LB[jc:C]LB[oj:A]LB[qj:B];W[re]C[Wrong.
Nope. 

Black's upper right framework come to nothing. And Black's marked stone does not have a big influence on the top, because of White's firm position.

Note that if Black did not have the stones A and B, then Black would have nothing to lose on the right side. And if the stone C was Black, then the triangled stone would have a bigger impact on the top.]TR[ob]LB[jc:C]LB[oj:A]LB[qj:B])
