(;B[ac]C[Wrong.
Black wants to prevent White from making a sente hane down the left side. But this hane is not a good way to solve that problem.

White can simply block at the triangled position. Black is back to the original problem, but White has eliminated the bad aji in the corner.]TR[ab])
(;B[ad]C[Wrong.
This descent is better than the hane. However, White can simply ignore this move. 

Note that Black can jump to A. Unfortunately, White can even ignore this move. So Black's initial descent lacks punch. 

Notice though that White cannot block Black's jump to A with B. Taking the other 2-1 point at C, Black would force a ko for the entire corner.]LB[ba:C]LB[ab:A]LB[ac:B])
(;B[ab]C[The correct tesuji. Now Black has a forcing follow-up. 

Play A to see what happens, if White blocks. Play B to see what happens, if White tenukis.]LB[ac:A]LB[jj:B](;W[ac]LB[ad:A];B[ad]C[Correct.
This is sente. White cannot ignore the descent, since Black would fight a ko for the whole corner at the triangled position.]TR[ba])
(;W[jj]C[What would you play now? A or B?]LB[ac:A]LB[ad:B](;B[ac]C[Wrong.
Yep. This is sente now.])
(;B[ad]C[Wrong.
Nope. White simply ignores this move.])
