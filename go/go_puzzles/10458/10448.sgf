PL[W]C[By sliding into the corner, White has a plan to create a base on the right side. Normally, Black would have played on the 3-3 point, instead of the attachment. But with the marked attachment, Black forces White to make a choice.

White to play.

What is White's response to the marked attachment?

TR[rc](;W[qc];B[qd]C[Changing plans to hane here is the only possible play.]TR[qc];W[rb];B[re];W[sc];B[qe]C[Correct.
White captures a stone, and Black cuts off the marked stone.

But this exchange benefits White more. White's good ponnuki shape is already alive, so White has kept sente.

Notice that this position is similar to the very common one in which White invades at the 3-3, instead of sliding up the right side. But in that case White's corner group has to end in gote to live.]TR[qf])
(;W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[od]C[Wrong.
Continuing with this plan to make a base on the right side is unsatisfactory. Black secures the territory in the top right corner, and White's shape is still somewhat defective. Black is encouraged by this success.])
